My name is Rodrigo Luzuriaga. I am a self-taught programmer currently working as a Computer Facilities Assistant (just the fancy title at my workplace for an IT Technician/Desktop Support).    

I have worked freelance jobs as an IT technician, Network Administrator, and System Administrator. In those jobs, I've have had to work on setting up servers (Windows 2012, RHEL/CentOS/Fedora, and Ubuntu servers), managing shared drives, user accounts, Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, backups, and more.   

I started programming JavaScript around 5 years ago and immediately loved it. I now have taken classes and made some programs in C/C++, Python, and Java. I've also had experience working on an e-commerce site for school using a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.    

I aspire to work doing what I love to do, which is programming. I have been programming in Python a lot recently working on a server side application for my current job. (You can read more about it [here.](/portfolio/printer-toner-inventory-system)) I have also been learning the Python web framework Django, and have been creating a website with it.
